# ROADKILL
Oh no! Youve been seperated from your glorious heap of garbage! To get back home navigate around cars and use trash bags to cross the river. 

# MVP
- title screen with instructions and a start button
- auto moving cars and trash bags
- use arrow keys to move raccoon
- if hit by car, game over
- if fall into water, game over
